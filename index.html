    Chapter 3 Sarai nearing publication

    In the Acacia data folder see R project (Acacia data.Rproj) as well as the
    .RData file. The environment     should already be loaded with data from the
     .RData file, but if you wanted to start from scratch, run
     Acacia.Environment.R, Acacia.iNEXT.preparedata.R 
    and Acacia.iNEXT.rarefaction.R in that order.
