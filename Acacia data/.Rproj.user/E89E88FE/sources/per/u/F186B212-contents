  *Figure 2. Sample-based rarefactions and extrapolations of insects collected from Vachellia sieberiana and Acacia mearnsii. q = 0 corresponds to species richness, q = 1 to the exponential of Shannon diversity and q = 2 to Inverse Simpson diversity (Chao et al., 2015). 95% confidence intervals were calculated by a bootstrap method based on 10 000 iterations. Solid and dashed portions of curves correspond to interpolated and extrapolated richness respectively.*
