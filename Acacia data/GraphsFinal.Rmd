## Figure 1

Figure 1. Morphospecies diversity by family by host tree category (plus all categories pooled). Acacia mearnsii includes all black wattle trees and Acacia mearnsii (adjacent) includes only the sites where Vachellia sieberiana co-occurs. Families are ordered on the X-axis by morphospecies richness in A. mearnsii. Sampling effort differs among the groups (A. mearnsii = 265 trees, A. mearnsii adjacent = 57 trees and V. sieberiana = 46 trees). Blue labels on the x-axis correspond to Order Coleoptera, red to Homoptera, and green to subfamilies within the ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae).

## Figure 2

*Figure 2. Sample-based rarefactions and extrapolations of insects collected from Vachellia sieberiana and Acacia mearnsii. q = 0 corresponds to species richness, q = 1 to the exponential of Shannon diversity and q = 2 to Inverse Simpson diversity (Chao et al., 2015). 95% confidence intervals were calculated by a bootstrap method based on 10,000 iterations. Solid and dashed portions of curves correspond to interpolated and extrapolated richness respectively.*
