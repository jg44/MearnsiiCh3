# Chapter 3 Sarai nearing publication

## Instruction for recreating results and output from Sarai

In the Acacia data folder see R project (Acacia data.Rproj) as well as the .RData file. The environment should already be loaded with data from the .RData file, but if you wanted to start from scratch, run Acacia.Environment.R, Acacia.iNEXT.preparedata.R
and Acacia.iNEXT.rarefaction.R in that order.


# message from Sarai about recreating Am-adjacent for new rarefaction curves:

 - all rows (inclusive of all the F #'s) with these four prefixes (MP3, MP4, KZN2 and KZN3) listed as Am are actually Am-adjacent.  Do I have that right? YES

 - What do the F #'s mean exactly? F IS the individual (each fogged tree, I used the F because the original idea was to use different collecting methods, so basically tree 1 , tree 2 ...)
