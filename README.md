# Chapter 3 Sarai nearing publication

## Instruction for recreating results and output from Sarai

In the Acacia data folder see R project (Acacia data.Rproj) as well as the .RData file. The environment should already be loaded with data from the .RData file, but if you wanted to start from scratch, run Acacia.Environment.R, Acacia.iNEXT.preparedata.R
and Acacia.iNEXT.rarefaction.R in that order.
